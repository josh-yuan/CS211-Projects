# CS211-Team-Project-1
first team project

Update 1: uploaded code for Interface Shape, abstract class abstractShape,
Joshua Yuan's Cube class, and my class (Joshua Warren) for
RectangularPrism.  

Also incorporated a Client class for testing.  

Update 2: all team member code has been uploaded.  I'll spend some time today 
with it before I shoot it back to the team for comments.
